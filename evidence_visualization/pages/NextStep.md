## Next Steps

### Strategy for Selling Starship Models

Using the information from our models, we can develop a comprehensive strategy to sell starship models to customers based on their properties. Here are some key attributes we can highlight to help customers make informed decisions:

- **Crew**: The number of personnel required to operate the starship.
- **Length**: The overall length of the starship, which can indicate its size and capacity.
- **Cost in Credits**: The price of the starship in galactic credits, helping customers understand the investment required.
- **Atmospheric Speed**: The maximum speed the starship can achieve within an atmosphere, which can be crucial for certain missions.

### Grouping for Easier Choices

To simplify the decision-making process for customers, we can categorize the starship models into three groups based on their attributes:

1. **Small Ships**: Ideal for quick, agile missions with minimal crew and lower costs.
2. **Medium Ships**: Balanced options that offer a good mix of speed, capacity, and cost.
3. **Large Ships**: Best suited for extensive missions requiring larger crews and higher capacities, with a corresponding increase in cost.

By presenting these groups, we can make it easier for customers to choose the starship model that best fits their needs and budget.
